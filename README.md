## The Learning Experince
I have remade this app a couple of times. The first time I coded
this I did it in plain jQuery. Then a third side was added with a 
server hosted by LearningFuze accessed with a regular AJAX call.
Then I used AngularJS to bind the javascript and the DOM. Finally,
and the part that I have yet to work properly, I am to use Firebase
as the backend. With Firebase and AngularJS, I can do a three way
binding, which means any changes on the server immediately get
updated on the browers, and vice versa. This was an entertaining
diffcult project that tested combining multiple frameworks together.
I plan to fix the three way binding in the near future, but for now,
it is a great display of AngularJS.

## Web Development Utilized 
* AngularJS 
* Firebase
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* git

## Future Features
* Three way binding with Firebase using AngularFire.
* Application descriptions.
* Displaying a loading icon for UX.
* Fix the inputs section as sticky on the screen, just for smaller resolutions.
